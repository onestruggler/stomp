# stomp
Input and output benchmark circuits of STOMP.

Feynman (https://github.com/meamy/feynman) has verified all 19 circuits. The final t-count is in the file under35_final.log

This folder contains 3 kinds of files:
1) the one without _i or _o is the input circuit of stomp.
2) the one with _i is the input circuit in .qc format.
3) the one with _o is the output circuit of stomp.

Also, the pair of _i and _o file is the input of feynver.

Thank Matt for timely adding new functionality in Feynman.
